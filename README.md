# Overview

This project is a supplement to my blog post - TBD, where I compare four state management patterns.

1. Prop Drilling
2. Context API
3. External Store (Zustand)
4. Flux Model (Redux, Redux-Toolkit)

I created identical functional examples for each pattern, showcasing the differences in the code.
